# School_District_Analysis
Module4
A high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics, presented in a table format
An overview of the key metrics for each school, presented in a table format
Tables presenting each of the following metrics:
Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
The average math score received by students in each grade level at each school
The average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school
School performance based on the budget per student
School performance based on the school size 
School performance based on the type of school

The school district summary will be a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics:

Total number of students
Total number of schools
Total budget
Average math score
Average reading score
Percentage of students who passed math
Percentage of students who passed reading
Overall passing percentage


 # To get the passing percentages, we need to:
 # 1. Determine what is the passing grade.
 # 2. Get the number of students who passed math and reading.
 # 3. Get the students who passed math and passed reading

You meet again with Maria and her supervisor and a question arises: how does school spending per student affect the school's average scores and passing percentages?  Maria tasks you with finding an answer to this question. This information will help the school board make decisions about the budget for the upcoming school year. Maria would like to see this data organized by spending ranges for the schools. You will need to create four spending bins, or ranges, to group the school spending per student.
